Developers' Change log
======================

* 2005-05-16 - The Neuromancer

	Done a heavy work on the multitasking subsystem and started the process loader thread. Details will follow.
	Made changes on the memory manager and added some GCC extensions to function for stricter error checking.

* 2005-05-11 - The Neuromancer

	Reorganized the building structure and the SVN repository. Now kernel and applications have their own directory
	and the kernel include files are separated from the SDK.

* 2005-05-10 - The Neuromancer

	Removed a bug in console_read which did not add a \0 character at the end of the read string.

	The system is now able to load the ELF executable of the shell and run it. We must implement now syscalls
	and a functional shell (waiting for Jack`).
	
	Minor changes and updates were made.

* 2005-05-07 - The Neuromancer

	The initialization is no more a bunch of messages written to the screen in a Linux-way, but now
	a cool progress bar is used to provide a view of the initialization process.

	The operating system has been renamed to Klesh.

* 2005-05-03 - The Neuromancer

	Found a bug on the floppy read routine which was waiting for 9 status data bytes at the end of the transfer
	instead of 7, causing very low performance (timeouts).

	The delay function has been replaced (actually, it still exists) by process_thread_sleep_time, which 
	reschedules the process without locking the entire system and using 100% the CPU.
	process_thread_sleep which was used to sleep the thread on an object has been renamed to process_thread_sleep_object.

	Started the change log.

	Started Nehemiah v0.0.3: the goal of this version is to have a functional Ext2 driver
	which can read the shell from the disk, load it on memory and run it.
	Other ideas are the change of the project name, the rewriting the driver structure
	(put them in Startup/Drivers/* from Drivers/*) and to provide a easy to understand (and cool too)
	view of the system loading.
