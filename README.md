I made this in 2004 after I dropped out of high school and had a lot of free time. It probably doesn't compile anymore, and IIRC it was tested with Bochs, a x86 simulator, so it might not even boot with modern x86 emulators such as QEMU or Virtualbox.

This is mostly kept as a memento of those fun years.
